# OpenFuelData
![openfueldata logo](/logo.png)

API and front end to show cheapest fuel in your area, provided by gov fuel price data. Note that this is an interim scheme and is limited, such as a delay between the setting of prices, the publication of price data, and the prices being available in third-party apps. Customers should always check the price displayed at the forecourt before purchasing road fuel.

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has stated it will publish its consultation on the end-state solution in autumn 2023. (Although I am unsure if this has come to fruition)
